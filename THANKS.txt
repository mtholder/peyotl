Several ideas about core package management and utility functions
were based on Jeet Sukumaran's work in the DendroPy package.

Thanks to http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/structure/ for good advice on package
structure.

Funding was provided by the National Science Foundation's award to the
Open Tree of Life project.
